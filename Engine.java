/**
 * The simulation is run by an internal timer that sends out a 'tick'
 * with a given interval. One tick from the timer means that each
 * entity in the pasture should obtain a tick. When an entity obtains
 * a tick, this entity is allowed to carry out their tasks according
 * to what kind they are. This could mean moving the entity, making
 * the entity starve from hunger, or producing a new offspring.
